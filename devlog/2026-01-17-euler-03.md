# Dev Log - 2026-01-17 (Euler 03)

Euler 03 is satisfied via `sd/pfind.asm`, which factors the target 64-bit value
(`N = 600851475143`) using 16-bit trial divisors and prints the factors in
decimal through `WIO 1` (line printer in decimal radix).

Run:
- `asm sd/pfind.asm`
- `lptradix A`
- `go 200 200000`

Result (from `media/print.out`):
```
71 839 1471 6857
```

The output line appeared twice due to the line printer file appending from a
prior run; both runs produced the same factor list, confirming the expected
largest prime factor (6857).
