# Dev Log - 2026-01-11 (Euler 02)

Euler 02 exercised more of the machine model than Euler 01. We had to extend
the ISA with special opcodes for I/O (`WIO`/`RIO` in the `030x` space), wire a
simple I/O bus, and build a practical line printer driver. That driver now
supports ASCII output by default and selectable radices (binary, octal,
decimal, hex) with configurable column widths and hard line breaks. Monitor
commands were added to set LPT columns and radix, plus a watch feature for
memory changes during `step`.

On the execution side we fixed several assembler and ISA friction points:
labels starting with `P` resolve correctly, Format 2 packing order matches
SIMH, and `BRO` branches on odd values (LSB set) while popping TOS. A small
hello program verified `WIO` output, and a watch on SUMA/SUMB made it easy to
confirm each accumulation.

The Fibonacci loop itself needed careful word ordering for `DCMP` and `DADD`,
plus correct compare placement so the last over-limit term does not affect
the sum. The final bug was simple: the sum had to start at 2 to include the
first even term. With that change, Euler 02 converged to 4,613,732 (octal
`000106 063144`) and the monitor halt confirmed the expected total.
