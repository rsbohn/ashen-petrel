Used SIMH strictly as an external instruction decoder and behavior oracle while
keeping code and design work independent to avoid licensing entanglement. The
main outcome was aligning Ashen's LOAD encoding and CC behavior with SIMH: the
bit pattern is `0 100 X I VVV VVV VVV`, so LOAD now decodes/assembles with the
correct X/I bits, and it updates CCA like SIMH. LDD/STD were brought into the
same X/I convention for both execution and disassembly, and LDI now updates
CCA while LDXI does not.
