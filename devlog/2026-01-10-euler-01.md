# Dev Log - 2026-01-10 (Euler 01)

Euler 01 ended up being a forcing function for Ashen Petrel. It pushed the ISA
beyond toy stack ops into real program behavior: we had to formalize the
two-opcode word model, define register stack semantics, add full-word
immediates, and build a working file assembler. Each time the program stalled
or misbehaved, it exposed a missing primitive (e.g., proper DIV stack effects,
TEST for CC, conditional branches, and carry/overflow handling), and we
iterated until the program became expressible.

It also validated the monitor UX. We had to make trace practical, fix
disassembly formatting, ensure octal output everywhere, and add label
resolution to the assembler. These are the kinds of sharp edges that only show
up when you run a nontrivial program end-to-end.

Most importantly, Euler 01 gave us a concrete correctness target. Seeing TOTAL
converge—and using flags to detect overflow and tune MAX—confirmed the machine
model is coherent. The exercise made the emulator feel like an actual machine,
not just a scaffold. It became both a spec and a test harness.
